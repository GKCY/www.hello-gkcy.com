在python的解释器中，输入：

	import this
	
会出现下面一首诗。

    Beautiful is better than ugly.   
    Explicit is better than implicit.  
	Simple is better than complex.  
	Complex is better than complicated.  
	Flat is better than nested.  
	Sparse is better than dense.  
	Readability counts.  
	Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.  
	Although practicality beats purity.  
	Errors should never pass silently.  
	Unless explicitly silenced.  
	In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  
	There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.  
	Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.  
	Now is better than never.  
	Although never is often better than right now.  
	If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  
	If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.  
	Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;这首诗名叫《The Zen of Pthon》，中文名叫做《Python之禅》。  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;由此可以看出，Python的设计哲学是“优雅”、“明确”、“简单”。Python开发者的哲学是“用一种方法，最好是只有一种方法来做一件事”。它可以让你专注于问题的本身，使你的思想从语法的束缚中解放出来。  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;人生苦短，我用Python!
